# ChatScrub

## Description
This project is a Python-based Discord bot combined with a Tkinter graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to search for and manage messages in specified Discord channels. The bot can search for messages containing specific keywords and display them in a scrollable GUI. Users can then select messages to delete them in bulk. This tool is particularly useful for moderators or administrators who need to clean up or manage messages in their Discord servers.

### Key Features:
- **Keyword Search**: Search for messages containing specific keywords in specified channels.
- **Bulk Deletion**: Select and delete multiple messages at once.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: A Tkinter-based interface for easy interaction.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: The bot runs asynchronously to ensure smooth performance.
